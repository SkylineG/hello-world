# hello-world
This is the first program at GitHub

I want to become a computer programmer. I enjoy problem solving and seeing my own creations come alive. I did not decide to become a programmer till I was 21 nearly 3 years ago. I have some experience in HTML/CSS Web-Development but I want to prosper in computer programming! Wish me luck !
